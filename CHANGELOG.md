# Revision history for seal-harness

## 0.1.0.0 — unreleased

* Project scaffolding. Subcommand CLI built on `configuration-tools`, a
  `ReaderT Env (KatipContextT IO)` application monad, IORef-based mutable
  state, and katip structured logging. The `greet` / `tick` commands are
  placeholder scaffolding demonstrating the patterns; they will be replaced
  by the SealOp ISA implementation (see the implementation plan in
  `docs/`).
